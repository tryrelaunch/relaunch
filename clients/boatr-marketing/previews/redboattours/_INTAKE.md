# Red Boat Tours — Boatr Preview Intake

Slug: `redboattours` · Brand: **Boatr** · Built: 2026-06-05
Preview URL (on deploy): https://boatrmarketing.com/preview/redboattours/
Source site: https://redboattours.com (WordPress + Elementor 4.1.1)

## §0 — Voice-scan override (approved)

`voice-scan.sh` reports 22 BOLD-TERM hits on `index.html`. All 22 are the **frozen SEO banner's** `<strong>lead.</strong>` rows, which are part of the golden template's frozen structure (`_TEMPLATE_README §1.1` — copy verbatim, do not restructure). Reworking them would mean editing a frozen component.

**Override approved by Nate, 2026-06-05:** keep the frozen banner as-is and skip the bold-term check for this client. The em-dash rule passes (1 em-dash in `index.html`, the banner signature). No banned words or phrases present.

- Typography: `Baloo 2` headings / `Nunito` body — closest Google-Font match to the hand-drawn logo lettering (per `_BRAND.md`; flag for Nate's approval).

## Audit used in the SEO banner (verified only)

- Live homepage title is "HOME - Red Boat Tours" (no target keyword)
- Ranks #5 for "st augustine boat tours" (1,100 searches/mo, Ahrefs)
- Meta description is a Father's Day promo (seasonal)
- Platform: Elementor 4.1.1 (dated)
- No tour-level schema on the live site
- Mobile PageSpeed: **TBD** — run `psi-check.sh` on the deploy URL. PSI free quota was exhausted 2026-06-05; the banner intentionally makes no speed claim until the real number is captured.

## Status

- [x] Homepage built from golden template; content swapped; 5 frozen components intact
- [x] Schema: LocalBusiness/TouristAttraction, Product+Offer per tour, FAQPage (Red Boat NAP, FareHarbor)
